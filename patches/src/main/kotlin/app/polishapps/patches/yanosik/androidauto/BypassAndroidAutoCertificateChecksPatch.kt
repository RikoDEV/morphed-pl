/**
 * Bypasses the Car App Library host certificate validation so Yanosik works on Android Auto.
 *
 * `pl.neptis.features.androidauto.nav.AutoService` extends `androidx.car.app.CarAppService` and
 * overrides the host validator getter (`a()`). In release builds it builds a validator with a
 * hardcoded host allowlist and validates the connected Android Auto host against it (host package
 * plus signing certificate, SHA-256). A re-signed / non-Play install, or an Android Auto host whose
 * certificate is not in the shipped allowlist, fails that check and the app does not work on
 * Android Auto.
 *
 * `n49.e` is the "Validator disabled, all hosts allowed" instance the library itself uses when the
 * app is debuggable, so returning it skips the certificate checks entirely.
